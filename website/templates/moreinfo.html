          <p>
            You have two kinds of cholesterol in your body: Low-density
            lipoprotein (LDL) is the unhealthy kind of cholesterol that clogs
            arteries. You want to keep your level below 100 mg/dL. <br />
            High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is the healthy kind that helps to
            clear LDL cholesterol out of your arteries. You want to aim for a
            level of 60 mg/dL or higher. <br />

            Beans and lentils Fish, especially salmon Olive oil Avocados Nuts
            and seeds, including chia and flax Natural peanut butter or any nut
            butter Whole grains, such as oatmeal, quinoa, brown rice or
            whole-wheat bread Fruit, especially high-fiber fruits like berries,
            apples and pears Vegetables, especially dark leafy greens and
            cruciferous vegetables like Brussels sprouts, broccoli and
            cauliflower Sweet potatoes and winter squash

          <h3>
            Lifestyle for the people with Cholestrol in the range of 200-240
          </h3>
          <p>
            Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. Pick “good” fats over
            “bad” fats. Limit the amount of saturated fat in your diet. Use
            healthier cooking methods. Meats are a good source of protein. But
            they contain a lot of cholesterol and saturated fats. Fish, beans,
            tree nuts, peas, and lentils also offer protein, but without the
            cholesterol and fats. They also contain fiber and other nutrients.
            Consider eating one meatless meal each week. Try substituting beans
            for meat in a favorite recipe, such as lasagna or chili. Snack on a
            handful of almonds or pecans. Soy is also an excellent source of
            protein. Good examples of soy include soymilk, edamame (green
            soybeans), tofu, and soy protein shakes. Get more fiber in your
            diet.

          <h3>Lifestyle for the High Cholestoral people</h3>
          <p>
            1. Eat heart-healthy foods <br />
            2. Exercise on most days of the week and increase your physical
            activity <br />
            3. Quit smoking <br />
            4. Lose weight <br />
            5.Avoid drinking of the alcohol. Full-fat dairy Whole milk, butter
            and full-fat yogurt and cheese are high in saturated fat. Cheese
            also tends to be high in sodium, and most Americans get too much
            sodium, too. Limit cheese to about 3 ounces per week, and choose
            part-skim cheese such as Swiss or mozzarella when cooking. Drink
            skim (non-fat), 1% or 2% milk to get your calcium intake. Look for
            non-fat or low-fat yogurt varieties. Use extra-virgin olive oil or
            avocado oil instead of butter. Red meat Steak, beef roast, ribs,
            pork chops and ground beef tend to have high saturated fat and
            cholesterol content. Choose 90% lean ground beef, lean cuts of beef
            (such as sirloin, tenderloin, filet or flank steak, pork loin or
            tenderloin), and focus on lower-fat sources of animal protein, such
            as baked skinless or lean ground poultry. Processed meat You should
            limit processed meat in general because of its high sodium content
            and low nutrition. In fact, bacon, sausage and hot dogs are usually
            made from fatty cuts of beef or pork. If you must eat processed
            meat, choose minimally processed sausage or deli meat made from lean
            turkey or chicken. Fried foods French fries, fried chicken with skin
            and other foods cooked in a deep fryer have a high amount of
            saturated fat and cholesterol from the oil they're cooked in. A
            better choice is baked chicken or turkey without the skin, baked
            potatoes or baked “fries” tossed with a little olive oil. Try using
            an air fryer for a lower-fat “fried” food taste. Baked goods and
            sweets Cookies, cakes and doughnuts usually contain butter or
            shortening, making them high in saturated fat and cholesterol. They
            also tend to be full of sugar, which can lead to high levels of
            blood triglycerides, an unhealthy blood fat (lipid) that can be a
            risk factor for coronary heart disease. Instead, make your desserts
            at home, choosing recipes that don't need shortening or lots of
            butter. This also allows you to modify recipes and cut down the
            amount of sugar used, to half or three-quarters the recommended
            amount. You can also enjoy baked fruit as a dessert, or substitute
            applesauce for eggs or butter in your baking.
