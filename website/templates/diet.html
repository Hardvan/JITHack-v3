          <h3>1.Control Your Portion Size</h3>
          <p>
            How much you eat is just as important as what you eat. Overloading
            your plate, taking seconds and eating until you feel stuffed can
            lead to eating more calories than you should. Portions served in
            restaurants are often more than anyone needs. Following a few simple
            tips to control food portion size can help you shape up your diet as
            well as your heart and waistline: Use a small plate or bowl to help
            control your portions. Eat more low-calorie, nutrient-rich foods,
            such as fruits and vegetables Eat smaller amounts of high-calorie,
            high-sodium foods, such as refined, processed or fast foods. It's
            also important to keep track of the number of servings you eat. Some
            things to keep in mind: A serving size is a specific amount of food,
            defined by common measurements such as cups, ounces or pieces. For
            example, one serving of pasta is about 1/3 to 1/2 cup, or about the
            size of a hockey puck. A serving of meat, fish or chicken is about 2
            to 3 ounces, or about the size and thickness of a deck of cards. The
            recommended number of servings per food group may vary depending on
            the specific diet or guidelines you're following. Judging serving
            size is a learned skill. You may need to use measuring cups and
            spoons or a scale until you're comfortable with your judgment.

          <h3>2.Eat More Vegetables and Fruits</h3>
          <p>
            Vegetables and fruits are good sources of vitamins and minerals.
            Vegetables and fruits are also low in calories and rich in dietary
            fiber. Vegetables and fruits, like other plants or plant-based
            foods, contain substances that may help prevent cardiovascular
            disease. Eating more fruits and vegetables may help you cut back on
            higher calorie foods, such as meat, cheese and snack foods.
            Featuring vegetables and fruits in your diet can be easy. Keep
            vegetables washed and cut in your refrigerator for quick snacks.
            Keep fruit in a bowl in your kitchen so that you'll remember to eat
            it. Choose recipes that have vegetables or fruits as the main
            ingredients, such as vegetable stir-fry or fresh fruit mixed into
            salads.

          <h3>3. Select whole grains</h3>
          <p>
            Whole grains are good sources of fiber and other nutrients that play
            a role in regulating blood pressure and heart health. You can
            increase the amount of whole grains in a heart-healthy diet by
            making simple substitutions for refined grain products. Or be
            adventuresome and try a new whole grain, such as whole-grain farro,
            quinoa or barley.

          <h3>4. Limit unhealthy fats</h3>
          <p>
            Limiting how much saturated and trans fats you eat is an important
            step to reduce your blood cholesterol and lower your risk of
            coronary artery disease. A high blood cholesterol level can lead to
            a buildup of plaques in the arteries, called atherosclerosis, which
            can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.

          <h3>5. Choose low-fat protein sources</h3>
          <p>
            Lean meat, poultry and fish, low-fat dairy products, and eggs are
            some of the best sources of protein. Choose lower fat options, such
            as skinless chicken breasts rather than fried chicken patties and
            skim milk rather than whole milk. Fish is a good alternative to
            high-fat meats. Certain types of fish are rich in omega-3 fatty
            acids, which can lower blood fats called triglycerides. You'll find
            the highest amounts of omega-3 fatty acids in cold-water fish, such
            as salmon, mackerel and herring. Other sources are flaxseed,
            walnuts, soybeans and canola oil. Legumes — beans, peas and lentils
            — also are good, low-fat sources of protein and contain no
            cholesterol, making them good substitutes for meat. Substituting
            plant protein for animal protein — for example, a soy or bean burger
            for a hamburger — will reduce fat and cholesterol intake and
            increase fiber intake.

          <h3>6. Limit or reduce salt (sodium)</h3>
          <p>
            Eating too much salt can lead to high blood pressure, a risk factor
            for heart disease. Limiting salt (sodium) is an important part of a
            heart-healthy diet. The American Heart Association recommends that:
            Healthy adults have no more than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium a
            day (about a teaspoon of salt) Most adults ideally have no more than
            1,500 mg of sodium a day Although reducing the amount of salt you
            add to food at the table or while cooking is a good first step, much
            of the salt you eat comes from canned or processed foods, such as
            soups, baked goods and frozen dinners. Eating fresh foods and making
            your own soups and stews can reduce the amount of salt you eat. If
            you like the convenience of canned soups and prepared meals, look
            for ones with no added salt or reduced sodium. Be wary of foods that
            claim to be lower in sodium because they are seasoned with sea salt
            instead of regular table salt — sea salt has the same nutritional
            value as regular salt. Another way to reduce the amount of salt you
            eat is to choose your condiments carefully. Many condiments are
            available in reduced-sodium versions. Salt substitutes can add
            flavor to your food with less sodium.

          <h3>7. Plan ahead: Create daily menus</h3>
          <p>
            Create daily menus using the six strategies listed above. When
            selecting foods for each meal and snack, emphasize vegetables,
            fruits and whole grains. Choose lean protein sources and healthy
            fats, and limit salty foods. Watch your portion sizes and add
            variety to your menu choices. For example, if you have grilled
            salmon one evening, try a black bean burger the next night. This
            helps ensure that you'll get all of the nutrients the body needs.
            Variety also makes meals and snacks more interesting.

          <h3>8. Allow yourself an occasional treat</h3>
          <p>
            Allow yourself an indulgence every now and then. A candy bar or
            handful of potato chips won't derail your heart-healthy diet. But
            don't let it turn into an excuse for giving up on your
            healthy-eating plan. If overindulgence is the exception, rather than
            the rule, you'll balance things out over the long term. What's
            important is that you eat healthy foods most of the time. Include
            these eight tips into your life, and you'll find that heart-healthy
            eating is both doable and enjoyable. With planning and a few simple
            substitutions, you can eat with your heart in mind.
